The Underground is
running 20 hours a day, every day
and serving all parts of central
London. The Underground (or
Tube) is one of the easiest ways to travel.
The map shows every Underground line
by name and in a different colour making it
really easy to plan your route to all the city’s
main attractions.
Tickets can be purchased from ticket
machines and ticket offices at all stations.
Entering and leaving the Underground is
made simple by the ticket operated gates.
At the end of your journey, if the value on
your ticket is used up, the gate will open but
your ticket will be retained. The Underground
is divided into six fare zones* with Zone 1
covering central London

..by bus
With over 17,000 bus stops all
across London you’re never far
from a bus route. And with only
two cash single fares covering the whole of
London, it’s especially simple to get around.
The bus network is divided into four zones:
Zone 1 covering central London and Zones
2, 3 & 4 covering outer London.
In London there are two types of bus stop
which are treated differently:

Compulsory, Buses always stop
here unless full.

Request. To stop a bus put out
your hand and the bus will stop,
unless already full. To get off at
a request stop ring the bell once
and in good time to let the driver know. Night
buses (prefixed with the letter N) treat all
stops as request stops.

..by tram
Tramlink serves the centre of
Croydon and radiates out to
Wimbledon. Leaving approximately
every 15 minutes it is one of the most
user-friendly ways to travel in south London.
Tickets can be purchased from automatic
ticket machines located at all tram stops and
Travelcards are accepted for travel.

...by rail
The National Rail network
covers the entire country,
leaving from central London
locations and spanning out to even the
remotest spots in the UK. Travelcards are
accepted within the Greater London area.
Beyond that you will need to purchase a
ticket for your journey either from the train
station or, in some cases, on the train.

..by taxi
Travelling in one of London’s
famous black cabs at any time of
day or night gives you a unique,
convenient and easy way of getting from
place to place and, more importantly, from
door to door. They are all wheelchair acces-
sible and have many other aids for disabled
customers

...by boat
Daily riverboat services operate
from most central London piers.
Services go to and from Greenwich
and the Thames barrier in the east and,
during the summer, as far as Hampton Court
in the west. You can purchase tickets for
most trips at the pier or, in some cases, on
the boat
